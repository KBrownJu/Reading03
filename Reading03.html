      <h2>what is the internet?</h2>
      <h3>As the lines of Ghost in the Shell said, “I feel confined, only free to expand myself within boundaries.”</h3>
      <h3>Network is like the sentence above – a product created while human beings perceives their boundaries? We are searching for the possibility of breaking the limit, yet without knowing that the definition we initially gave to the network has been long exceeded by its significance. If each webpage represents a person’s soul, the network will be a combination of human souls. With the digitalization of souls, network becomes a mirror that can examine our souls while reflecting our bodies.
      </h3>
      <h3>To me, webpage might be the extension of my soul – replacing myself with the form of codes and exposing myself in network, seeking limits and identity. Though I dare not to declare that webpage represents all of me, it has been a part of my soul indeed and reminds me all the time who I am and where am I. </h3>
